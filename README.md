# premier_league_predictor

After watching "A million Simulated Seasons - Numberphile", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv9wpQIGZDw, I was disappointed in their use of simply using the 2017-2018 league table for the basis of their analysis. I think this excercise will be better served using a larger dataset to seed the simulation. I have taken the datasets available from http://openfootball.github.io/ to try to come up with a better answer for how many points is enough to be the Champion, qualify for the Champions Leauge, and avoid relegation.
